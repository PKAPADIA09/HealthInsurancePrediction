# HealthInsurancePrediction
The topic of interest of me would be to predict the health insurance increase in every term. 
Health insurance has different cost for every single individual, but the difference in those 
prices is due to variance in the style of living, income, age, and some many more important factors. 
Therefore, I wanted to find those factors and predict future cost of health care insurance.

I am planning to use Python libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression) 
for prediction of future per term increase in health insurance.
